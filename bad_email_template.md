Hello,

I received a ballot for [BALLOT PERIOD] from this email address for the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group (PPG), but I cannot find the email address in our records. Please let me know if you want to use this email address.

Your ballot will not be counted this time because your email address was not on the list during the voting period.

If this does not sound familiar, please ignore it and I apologize for the inconvenience.

Best Regards,
